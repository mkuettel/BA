	abstract = {Peer-to-Peer (kurz meist P2P genannt, von englisch peer „Gleichgestellter“, „Ebenbürtiger“) und Rechner-Rechner-Verbindung sind synonyme Bezeichnungen für eine Kommunikation unter Gleichen, hier bezogen auf ein Rechnernetz. In einigen Kontexten spricht man auch von Querkommunikation.
In einem reinen Peer-to-Peer-Netz sind alle Computer gleichberechtigt und können sowohl Dienste in Anspruch nehmen, als auch zur Verfügung stellen. In modernen P2P-Netzwerken werden die Netzwerkteilnehmer jedoch häufig abhängig von ihrer Qualifikation in verschiedene Gruppen eingeteilt, die spezifische Aufgaben übernehmen. Kernkomponente aller modernen Peer-to-Peer-Architekturen, die meist bereits als Overlay-Netz auf dem Internet realisiert werden, ist daher ein zweites internes Overlay-Netz, welches normalerweise aus den besten Computern des Netzwerks besteht und die Organisation der anderen Computer sowie die Bereitstellung der Such-Funktion übernimmt.
Mit der Suchfunktion („lookup“) können Peers im Netzwerk diejenigen Peers identifizieren, die für eine bestimmte Objektkennung (Object-{ID}) zuständig sind. In diesem Fall ist die Verantwortlichkeit für jedes einzelne Objekt mindestens einem Peer fest zugeteilt, man spricht daher von strukturierten Overlays. Mittels der Such-Operation können die Peers nach Objekten im Netzwerk suchen, die gewisse Kriterien erfüllen (z. B. Datei- oder Buddynamen-Übereinstimmung). In diesem Fall gibt es für die Objekte im P2P-System keine Zuordnungsstruktur, man spricht also von unstrukturierten Overlays.
Sobald die Peers, die die gesuchten Objekte halten, in dem P2P-System identifiziert wurden, wird die Datei (in Dateitauschbörsen) direkt, d. h. von Peer zu Peer, übertragen. Es existieren unterschiedliche Verteilungsstrategien, welche Teile der Datei von welchem Peer heruntergeladen werden soll, z. B. {BitTorrent}.
Der Gegensatz zum Peer-to-Peer-Modell ist das Client-Server-Modell. Bei diesem bietet ein Server einen Dienst an und ein Client nutzt diesen Dienst. In Peer-to-Peer-Netzen ist diese Rollenverteilung aufgehoben. Jeder Teilnehmer ist ein peer, denn er kann einen Dienst gleichermaßen nutzen und selbst anbieten.},

	abstract = {With the increased focus on Internet privacy, especially after the exposure of {PRISM}(an Internet surveillance program), anonymous communication have been getting more and more attentions. One of the most widely used anonymous communication systems is I2P(Invisible Internet Project). And as opposed to Tor’s(another popular anonymous communication system) directory-based approach, which provides a centralized directory server to manage the overall ‘view’ of the network, I2P is fully distributed and self organizing, which aims to avoid attackers’ enumeration of all I2P’s routers. In this paper, based on I2P’s operating mechanism, we presented two passive and two active methods to discover I2P routers. In a more than two week’s collecting experiment, about 25640 routers were discovered everyday, which turned out to be an almost full coverage(94.9\%) of the I2P network compared with the data announced on the ofﬁcial website [1]. And based on the routers collected, this paper further made a preliminary analysis of both the I2P network’s overall status and its security. The result showed that I2P is a well structured P2P network, while some powerful attackers operating several routers are still possible to perform compromise attack to break I2P users’ anonymity given the current I2P’s security mechanism. Finally, this paper discussed some countermeasures to improve the security of the I2P network.},

	abstract = {The prevalence of Internet censorship has prompted the creation of several measurement platforms for monitoring ﬁltering activities. An important challenge faced by these platforms revolves around the trade-off between depth of measurement and breadth of coverage. In this paper, we present an opportunistic censorship measurement infrastructure built on top of a network of distributed {VPN} servers run by volunteers, which we used to measure the extent to which the I2P anonymity network is blocked around the world. This infrastructure provides us with not only numerous and geographically diverse vantage points, but also the ability to conduct in-depth measurements across all levels of the network stack. Using this infrastructure, we measured at a global scale the availability of four different I2P services: the ofﬁcial homepage, its mirror site, reseed servers, and active relays in the network. Within a period of one month, we conducted a total of 54K measurements from 1.7K network locations in 164 countries. With different techniques for detecting domain name blocking, network packet injection, and block pages, we discovered I2P censorship in ﬁve countries: China, Iran, Oman, Qatar, and Kuwait. Finally, we conclude by discussing potential approaches to circumvent censorship on I2P.},

Tor’s centralized directory services facilitate the understanding of the Tor network, as well as the measurement and visualization of its structure through the Tor Metrics project. In contrast, I2P does not rely on centralized directory servers, and thus obtaining a complete view of the network is challenging. In this work, we conduct an empirical study of the I2P network, in which we measure properties including population, churn rate, router type, and the geographic distribution of I2P peers. We find that there are currently around 32K active I2P peers in the network on a daily basis. Of these peers, 14K are located behind {NAT} or firewalls.},

	abstract = {Focused crawlers enable the automatic discovery of Web resources about a given topic by automatically navigating through the Web link structure and selecting the hyperlinks to follow by estimating their relevance to the topic of interest. This work proposes a generic focused crawling framework for discovering resources on any given topic that reside on the Surface or the Dark Web. The proposed crawler is able to seamlessly navigate through the Surface Web and several darknets present in the Dark Web (i.e., Tor, I2P, and Freenet) during a single crawl by automatically adapting its crawling behavior and its classifier-guided hyperlink selection strategy based on the destination network type and the strength of the local evidence present in the vicinity of a hyperlink. It investigates 11 hyperlink selection methods, among which a novel strategy proposed based on the dynamic linear combination of a link-based and a parent Web page classifier. This hybrid focused crawler is demonstrated for the discovery of Web resources containing recipes for producing homemade explosives. The evaluation experiments indicate the effectiveness of the proposed focused crawler both for the Surface and the Dark Web.},

	abstract = {Blockchains are turning into decentralized computing platforms and are getting worldwide recognition for their unique advantages. There is an emerging trend beyond payments that blockchains could enable a new breed of decentralized applications, and serve as the foundation for Internet’s security infrastructure. The immutable nature of the blockchain makes it a winner on security and transparency; it is nearly inconceivable for ledgers to be altered in a way not instantly clear to every single user involved. However, most blockchains fall short in privacy aspects, particularly in data protection. Garlic Routing and Onion Routing are two of major Privacy Enhancing Techniques ({PETs}) which are popular for anonymization and security. Garlic Routing is a methodology using by I2P Anonymous Network to hide the identity of sender and receiver of data packets by bundling multiple messages into a layered encryption structure. The Onion Routing attempts to provide lowlatency Internet-based connections that resist traffic analysis, deanonymization attack, eavesdropping, and other attacks both by outsiders (e.g. Internet routers) and insiders (Onion Routing servers themselves). As there are a few controversies over the rate of resistance of these two techniques to privacy attacks, we propose a {PET}-Enabled Sidechain ({PETES}) as a new privacy enhancing technique by integrating Garlic Routing and Onion Routing into a Garlic Onion Routing ({GOR}) framework suitable to the structure of blockchains. The preliminary proposed {GOR} aims to improve the privacy of transactions in blockchains via {PETES} structure.},

	shorttitle = {Ethna},
	abstract = {As the communication infrastructure of the blockchain system, the underlying peer-to-peer (P2P) network has a crucial impact on the efﬁciency and security of the upper-layer blockchain such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. However, current Ethereum blockchain explorers (e.g., the Etherscan) focus on the tracking of block and transaction records but omit the characterization of the underlying P2P network. This work presents the Ethereum Network Analyzer (Ethna), a tool that probes and analyzes the P2P network of the Ethereum blockchain. Unlike Bitcoin that adopts an unstructured P2P network, Ethereum relies on the Kademlia {DHT} to manage its P2P network. Therefore, the existing analyzing methods proposed for Bitcoin-like P2P networks are not applicable to Ethereum. In Ethna, we implement a novel method that can accurately measures the degrees of Ethereum nodes; moreover, we design an algorithm that derives the latency metrics of the message dissemination in the Ethereum network. We run Ethna on the Ethereum Mainnet and conduct extensive experiments to analyze the topological features of its P2P network. Our analysis shows that the Ethereum P2P network conforms to the smallworld property, and the degrees of nodes follow a power-law distribution that characterizes scale-free networks.},

	abstract = {A friend-to-friend (or F2F) computer network is a type of peer-to-peer network in which users only make direct connections with people they know. Passwords or digital signatures can be used for authentication.
Unlike other kinds of private P2P, users in a friend-to-friend network cannot find out who else is participating beyond their own circle of friends, so F2F networks can grow in size without compromising their users' anonymity. Retroshare, {WASTE}, {GNUnet}, Freenet and {OneSwarm} are examples of software that can be used to build F2F networks, though {RetroShare} is the only one of these configured for friend-to-friend operation by default.
Many F2F networks support indirect anonymous or pseudonymous communication between users who do not know or trust one another. For example, a node in a friend-to-friend overlay can automatically forward a file (or a request for a file) anonymously between two friends, without telling either of them the other's name or {IP} address. These friends can in turn automatically forward the same file (or request) to their own friends, and so on.
Dan Bricklin coined the term "friend-to-friend network" in 2000.},

An introduction to their overall structure is given, followed by a detailed description of the core parts of both networks. Furthermore, a comparison of both will feature important aspects like node selection, performance and scalability. The detailed description and comparison of the two systems show that determining which system to use highly depends on the field of application, since each system has its strength and weaknesses in specific areas.},

Dedicated anonymous networks such as Freenet and I2P allow anonymous file-sharing among users. However, one major problem with anonymous file-sharing networks is that the available content is highly reduced, mostly with outdated files, and non-anonymous networks, such as the {BitTorrent} network, are still the major source of content: we show that in a 30-days period, 21648 new torrents were introduced in the {BitTorrent} community, whilst only 236 were introduced in the anonymous I2P network, for four different categories of content. Therefore, how can a user of these anonymous networks access this varied and non-anonymous content without compromising its anonymity? In this paper, we improve content availability in an anonymous environment by proposing the first internetwork model allowing anonymous users to access and share content in large public communities while remaining anonymous. We show that our approach can efficiently interconnect I2P users and public {BitTorrent} swarms without affecting their anonymity nor their performance. Our model is fully implemented and freely usable.},

Among anonymous enabled services, anonymous file-sharing is one of the most active one and is increasingly growing. Large scale monitoring on these systems allows us to grasp how they behave, which type of data is shared among users, the overall behaviour in the system. But does large scale monitoring jeopardize the system anonymity? In this work we present the first large scale monitoring architecture and experiments on the I2P network, a low-latency message-oriented anonymous network. We characterize the file-sharing environment within I2P, and evaluate if this monitoring affects the anonymity provided by the network. We show that most activities within the network are file-sharing oriented, along with anonymous web-hosting. We assess the wide geographical location of nodes and network popularity. We also demonstrate that group-based profiling is feasible on this particular network.},

The usability of such a tool plays not only a prominent role for each single user; in the area of anonymization networks it usually holds that the protection for every single user is higher, the more users participate. Hence, usability is of great importance, since bad usability decreases the number of potential users. In this paper we examine the usability of four software implementations for anonymous communication techniques especially with regards to the installation procedure. The usability is evaluated with the help of cognitive walk-throughs. We also inspect the quality of service of these implementations by means of a performance test.},

This report looks into the history and development of the software, the way I2P works and provides a short developers guide for setting up a website within the I2P network. Next to that, some applications of I2P are covered, including anonymous emailing, web hosting and file sharing. Furthermore, I2P is compared to another anonymizing internet technology called Tor by looking at their strengths and weaknesses with regard to different applications. It is concluded that I2P currently offers high levels of anonymity and is quicker than Tor for some applications within a Darknet. Though, for accessing the regular Internet anonymously, Tor proves to be a better option. However, I2P is still beta software which requires more development. With more research, funding and a larger user base it could potentially provide a faster and more secure way of using Internet services anonymously than is currently offered by other applications.},

We conﬁrm the trilemma that an {AC} protocol can only achieve two out of the following three properties: strong anonymity (i.e., anonymity up to a negligible chance), low bandwidth overhead, and low latency overhead.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we studied the effects of sharing the bandwidth on the I2P network on the anonymity level it provides to the users. To this end, we explored what could be achieved by a potential attacker on the I2P Network in terms of application and user profiling. In both cases, the effect of bandwidth participation has been been analyzed. To achieve this, we used a machine learning based approach to analyze the flows extracted from the traffic generated by the applications and the users. Our results show that profiling the users and applications on the I2P network is possible. The amount of shared bandwidth has an effect on the accuracy of profiling the users and the applications. Furthermore, applications that do not use the shared clients tunnels increases the possibility to profile the behavior of the flows for these applications.},
